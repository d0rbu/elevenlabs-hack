# speakeasy

our elevenlabs hackathon project! a dating app that makes a digital clone of you to make your profile much more interactive and engaging. go beyond judging a person's value merely from a few pictures and text blurbs.

## tech

this is a sveltekit project, run it with
```bash
pnpm run dev
```

it uses supabase, the eleven labs api, and the fal.ai api. the `.env` file should contain:

```bash
PRIVATE_ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=sk_*
PRIVATE_FAL_AI_KEY=*
PUBLIC_SUPABASE_API_KEY=*
PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ENDPOINT=*
PUBLIC_ONBOARDING_AGENT_ID=hg1nXWYvV4OMLu8PECu6
```

thanks for checking us out!
